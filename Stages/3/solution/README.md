# Solution

## What have we Learned?

- Template Specialization
    - Explicit (full) Template Specialization
    - Partial Template Specialization
    - What is the Primary Template
    - Syntax of primary template and specializations
- Creating our own type traits using full and partial specializations
- Using *variable templates* (`template<...> constexpr bool is_human_v = ...`, in this stage)
