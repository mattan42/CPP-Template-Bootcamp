# C++ Template Bootcamp

## Objective

As a C++ developer, templates are an extremely powerful asset in your toolbox. The objective of this "bootcamp" is to get you started with templates meta-programming in C++ by giving you a "hand-on" experience. This bootcamp contains examples, use-cases and problems that hopefully will give you a good idea how to use templates, when to use templates, and how you can utilize it to solve the problems you encounter.

## How to go Through the Bootcamp

> [!INFO]
> The bootcamp can be done completely alone.

The bootcamp is separated to stages. Each stage contains a `problem` directory and a `solution` directory.

The `problem` directory will contain a README file that explains the problem. Sometimes it will include other files, some you will have permission to edit and some you will be asked to leave as is.

The `solution` directory will contain:
- a README file that explains the given solution.
- The given solution (header and source files)

### Compiling the Solutions

Run `cmake` from the root of this directory.

If you're using linux, you can just run `make`.
