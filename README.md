# C++ Template Bootcamp

## Objective

As a C++ developer, templates are an extremely powerful asset in your toolbox. The objective of this "bootcamp" is to get you started with templates meta-programming in C++ by giving you a "hand-on" experience. This bootcamp contains examples, use-cases and problems that hopefully will give you a good idea how to use templates, when to use templates, and how you can utilize it to solve the problems you encounter.


## What to Expect From this Bootcamp

Templates, while being one of the most powerful features in c++, are known to be notoriously hard to grasp, and for good reasons.
They require you
- To have intimate understanding of what the compiler does when handling templates
- To understand complex syntaxes
- To work close to the standard in order to understand what you can do and what you can't
- To think at a "higher level" - you're writing code that "writes code".

Thus, this bootcamp is not going to be "write a lot of code", but rather:
- Read and work closely to the standard. "cppreference" is a great website that will be mentioned and referenced countless times.
- Trial and Error until you get that right. The objectives may seem simple and clear, but their solutions might not be so simple as they sound. Don't give up! keep the cycle of trying, failing, reading & learning, trying again, until you nail that down.
- Reading the solutions thouroughly, *even if you solved the objectives successfully*.

This bootcamp won't teach you everything, as this would be an impossible task for a humble coding bootcamp. However, it hope it will give you a strong grasp of the basics of how templates work, the features we can utilize, and help you solve template-related problems in the future.


## How to go Through the Bootcamp

> [!INFO]
> The bootcamp can be done completely alone.

The bootcamp is separated to stages. Each stage contains a `problem` directory and a `solution` directory.

The `problem` directory will contain a README file that explains the problem. Sometimes it will include other files, some you will have permission to edit and some you will be asked to leave as is.

The `solution` directory will contain:
- a README file that explains the given solution.
- The given solution (header and source files)

### Compiling the Solutions

Run `cmake` from the root of this directory.

If you're using linux, you can just run `make`.
